## Chapter 10: Buffer Cache

- Two components are stored in the buffer cache: __Header Area__ and __Data Area__. Data area contains one block of the secondary storage. When there is a memory miss, then the CPU checks the buffer cache to see if the data block is in the data area before going directly to the secondary storage. If the block of data is in the buffer cache, then it is taken directly into user area of memory. If the data block is not in the buffer cache, then the CPU must go to access the data block from disk and then bring into the buffer cache. 

- Essentially, the purpose of the buffer cache is used to reduce the frequency of disk access. 

- If all the buffer cache is being used then one block is victimized using the LRU technique used in the Page memory management technique.

- The header area is used for block identification. It contains __devise no__, __block no__ and __status__ which is obtained from the block found in the secondary storage. 

- Blocks found in the buffer area are maintained using double-linked lists. One of the pointer point to the Data Area. Another pointer points to __next buffer hash queue__. And the next pointer is pointing to the __previous buffer on hash queue__. Another one point to the __next buffer on free buffer list__. And the last one which points to the __previous buffer on free buffer list__.

- The __status__ field contains information about whether the buffer is:
  + currently blocked 
  + contains corrupted data
  + delayed write (when preparing changes to be rewritten to secondary storage)
  + buffer <--> secondary storage
