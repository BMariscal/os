## Chapter 1.2: System Structures

- Bus connects the drive to the computer

- Host controller (end of bus) allows for transferring of commands (via messages) to the disk controller (built inside the drive).

- Disk controllers usually have a built-in cache.

- SSD - have no moving parts, no latency, consume less power; expensive, less capacity, shorter life span; directly connected to the system bus (PCI); 

- magnetic tapes - slower access time than magnetic disks and main memory; these types of tapes are mainly used for backups;
