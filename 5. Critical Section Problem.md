## Chapter 5: Critical Section Problem

- Whenever a variable (e.g., counter) is being accessed and modified by two different processes, such as the consumer and producer process, this kind of problem is known as the __critical section problem__. 

- A plausible solution is to only allow either the producer process or consumer process to access the variable, finish its operation and then allow for the other to access and modify the variable. This can also be called the __atomic property__. It can also be referred to as __mutually exclusive__.

- These are the following requirements that must be met to solve the critical section problem:
    + __Mutual Exclusion (ME)__ - only one process should be given access to the critical section at a time. 
    + __Progress__ - Given a set of processes _P = {P1, P2, ...,Pn}_, only one process _P(i)_ should be allowed to enter the __critical region_. The rest of processes must wait until _P(i)_ finishes. The decision about who goes into the critical section can only be taken by the processes that are set to go into the critical section, and must be taken in finite time. 
    + __Bounded Waiting__ - When a process _P(i)_ has put a request to enter the critical section at time _T(o)_, it must wait until no process is running in the critical section. It also means that no other process can enter the critical section before the selecting process _P(i)_. It serves as a assurance that its request to enter the critical section is satisfied.

- The __Entry Section__ - decides what process can enter into the critical section. A __lock__ is used to indicate that no other process can enter the critical section. 

- The __Exit Section__ - decides when the critical section becomes unlocked and free to accept another process.  

- The __Remainder Section__ - this is part of the code that doesn't involve the critical section. 

- Given _P(1)_ and _P(2)_ and a shared variable __turn__, which takes value of 1 and 2, the following code inserts a process into the critical section:

```C
P(i): While turn != i do skip; //execute next line if its a process turn
        CS
      turn = j; // change turn
```
  
- The previous code satisfies ME, ensuring that no two processes enter the critical section simultaneously. 

- If a process _P(1)_ in the critical section terminates and gives control to a Process _P(2)_ that doesn't want to go into the critical section, we won't be able to meet progress. The reason is because _P(2)_ doesn't have an exit statement that indicates to give the critical section to another process _P(1)_

- The following algorithm satisfies the __Progress__ criteria:

```C
flag: array [0..1] of boolean
P(i)  While flag[j] do skip; // decides if P(i) can go into the critical section
      flag[i] = True;
        CS
      flag[i] = False;
```

- With the above code, progress is satisfied but ME is not satisfied.

```C
// Shared variables
  var flag: array[0..1] of boolean;
      turn: 0..1;
P(i): flag[i] = true
      turn = j; // check if P(j) wants access to Critical Section
      while(flag[j] and turn = j) do skip; // if any is false, then execute next line.
        CS
      flag[i] = false; 
```

- The above algorithm meets the three requirements: ME, progress and boundedness. Therefore, it is a correct solution to solve the critical section problem for two processes. 

- For _n_ process, the following algorithm is the solution:

```C
Common (Global) variables:
  var flag: array[0..n-1] of (idle, want_in, in_cs);
  turn: 0..n-1;
P(i): var j:0..n;
      // Entry section of code
      repeat 
        flag[i] =  want_in;
        j =  turn;
        while j!= i do
          if flag[i] != idle then j = turn;
          else j = (j+1) mod n;
        flag[i] = in_cs;
        j = 0;
        while (j < n) and (j = i or flag[j] != in_cs) do
          j = j + 1;
      until (j >= n) and (turn = i or flag[turn] = idle);
      turn = ij;
      // critical section
      CS
      // exit section of code
      j = (turn + 1) mod n;
      while (flag[i] = idle) do  j = (j + 1) mod n;
      turn = j;
      flag[i] = idle;
      // remainder section
      RS
```
- There are some other implementations that can provide a solution to the critical section problem. These solution are categorize in two types of solutions: __Software Solution__ and __Hardware Solution__. An example of a hardware solution used in solving the critical solution problem is given in the following snippets of code:

```C
function Test_and_Set(var target: boolean): boolean;
  begin
    Test_and_Set = target;
    target = True;
  end;
```
```C
Procedure swap(var a,b: boolean);
  var temp: boolean;
  begin
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  end;
```

```C
Common (Global) variables:
  var waiting: array[0..n-1] of boolean;
  lock: boolean;
P(i): // local variables
      var j: 0..n-1;
      key: boolean;
      // entry section
      waiting[i] = true
      key = true;
      while (waiting[i] and key) do key = Test_and_Set(lock);
      // the critical section
      CS
      // the exit section (this decides what goes into CS next)
      j = (i + 1) mod n;
      while (j != i) and (not waiting[j]) do j = (j + 1) mod n;
      if j = 1 then lock = false;
        else waiting[j] = false;
```
