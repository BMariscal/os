## Chapter 6: Deadlock Part 3 (Distributed Environment)

- Resources and processes are located on different machines. 

- In distributed environment, the deadlock avoidance algorithm is inefficient. The better algorithms to use in such environment are deadlock detection &recovery or deadlock prevention.

- A __central coordinator__ maintains information on the resources requested from processed in the distributed environment. This information can be sent periodically from the machine executing the processes. Or it can be sent after every process finishes execution. 


- Scenario for analysis:
```Pascal
// Machine 0 (R means resource and P means process)
Pa <-- Rs, Pa --> Rr, Rr --> Pb

// Machine 1
Pc --> Rs, Pc < -- Rt

// The global resource graph maintained by central coordinator
Pc --> Rs, Pc < -- Rt,Pa <-- Rs, Pa --> Rr, Rr --> Pb
```

- Currently there is no cycle, so there is no deadlock. If _Pb_ releases _Rr_ and requests _Rt_ from _Machine_1 , there is a possibility that there will be a false alert of deadlock, which is also called __False Deadlock__. This happens because the central coordinator got update from _Machine 1_ first before the release request of _Rr_ from _Machine 0_.  

- This can avoided using a __global clock__ that contains the __timestamp__ of the request and releases of resources. 
 
- Such approach is also called a __Centralized Deadlock Detection__.

- There is another type of deadlock detection mechanism called __Distributed Deadlock Detection__.
