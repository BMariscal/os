## Chapter 4: Concurrent Processing

- There are two types of structures in concurrent processing: `Fork/Join` and `Cobegin/Coend`.

- Given the following example of precedence graph: S1 --> S2; S1 --> S3; S2 --> S4; S2 --> S5; S4 --> S6; S5 --> S6; S3 --> S7; S6 --> S7. The following is the algorithm that satisfies the `Cobegin/Coend` construct:

```C
begin
  S1;
  Cobegin
    S3;
    begin //sequential process
      S2;
        Cobegin
          S4;
          S5;
        Coend
      S6;
    end
  Coend
  S7;
end
```

- In the `Cobegin/Coend` structure, it ensures that the parent process continues execution. Conversely, in the `Fork/Join` structure, there is no guarantee since either the parent or child process can continue the execution and the processes are terminated. 


- Given the following example of precedence graph: S1 --> S2; S1 --> S3; S2 --> S4; S4 --> S5; S4 --> S6; S3 --> S6; S5 --> S7; S6 --> S7; 


- The previous example cannot be represented using a `Cobegin/Coend` structure because of the redundant relation between S3 --> S6. On the other hand, the precedence graph can be represented using `Fork/Join` structure, which makes this structure more stronger than the `Cobegin/Coend` structure.


- **Producer/Consumer Problem**: The items produced by the producer process are consumed by the consumer process. The consumer process will be able to consume items independent of producer process. If the consumer process consumes items at a faster rate than what the producer process can produce, then it will have to naturally wait. On the other hand, if the producer process produces items at a faster rate than what the consumer process can consumer, then some items are lost. A typical example of such model is the printer. The computer is the produce and the printer in the consumer. The printer consumes the items in the form of printing the items. 


- A **buffer** can be used to deal with the speed mismatch between producing and consuming rate.


- There are two types of buffers: **Unbounded buffer** and **Bounded buffer**. Bounded buffer would force the producer process to wait when the buffer gets full. Unbounded buffer forces the consumer process to wait if the rate of consumer process is higher than the rate of the produce process. There could be a time when the unbounded buffer has no items. 


- The producer/consumer problem can be algorithmically represented using the following code:

```java
type item = ;
  var buffer = array[0..n-1] of item;
    in, out = 0..n-1;
    nextp, nextc: item;
    in = 0;
    out = 0;    
```

- The `Cobegin/Coend` structure for the _producer process_ is as follows:

```C
cobegin
  producer: //producer process
    begin
      repeat
        ...
        produce an item in nextp;
        ...
        while(in+1) mod n = out do skip;
        buffer[in] = nextp; //input next item in buffer location (in)
        in = (in+1) mod n;
      until false
    end
  end
coend
```

- The `Cobegin/Coend` structure for the _consumer process_ is as follows:

```C
cobegin
  consumer: //consumer process
    begin
      repeat
        while in = out do skip; //check that the buffer is empty; if not, goto next line.
        nextc = buffer[out];
        out = (out+1) mod n;
        ...
        consume item in nextc;
        ...
        until false
      end
    end
  end
coend
```

- In the algorithm above, we assume that both the consumer and producer process goes on producing and consuming items indefinitely. Additionally, the algorithm assumes that at least one location in the buffer must be free. A _counter_ is used to keep track of how many items are in the buffer so as to facilitate the inserting and getting items from the buffer. The algorithm can be modified to use the counter as follows:

```C
cobegin
  producer: //producer process
    begin
      repeat
        ...
        produce an item in nextp;
        ...
        __while count = n do skip;__ //if the counter is the same as the amount of items, skip below process.
        buffer[in] = nextp; //input next item in buffer location (in)
        in = (in+1) mod n;
        __count = count + 1__
      until false
    end
  end
coend
```

```C
cobegin
  consumer: //consumer process
    begin
      repeat
        __while count = 0 do skip;__ //check if true; if not, goto next line.
        nextc = buffer[out];
        out = (out+1) mod n;
        count = count - 1;
        ...
        consume item in nextc;
        ...
        until false
      end
    end
  end
coend
```
