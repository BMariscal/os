### :point_right: About

A useful handbook for getting to know the basics on Operating System Concepts. I am preparing this handbook as a study guide for my PhD qualification exams but it can be used for any level of studies. Feel free to make pull requests as there might be plenty of grammatical and spelling errors in the content. I will try to update it as often as possible. Check for continuous updates here.
