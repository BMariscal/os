## Chapter 6: Deadlock

- __Review:__ The main function of the operating system is to manage the resources which are to be shared by more than one processes. 

- Given two processes _P1_ and _P2_, requiring two resources _A_ and _B_... There could be a scenario where _P1_ has acquired resource _A_ and is waiting for resource _B_, which has been acquired by another process _P2_, which is also waiting for the same process that was initially acquired by _P1_. This situation leads to a __deadlock__ where both processes will never complete since they both depend on resources which were previously acquired by either one them. 

- The deadlock problem can also be modeled this way: _P1_ acquires _A_ and _P2_ acquires B; _P1_ needs _B_ to complete and _P2_ needs _A_ to complete. 

- To avoid deadlock the assigning of resources to processes needs an efficient assigning mechanism. This can done using the concept of requesting where a process that needs a resource must first request to use that resource. A life cycle or sequence of a request for a resource: __Request__ --> __Use__ --> __Release__.

- __Deadlock Definition__:
> A set of processes is said to be in deadlock when every process in the set waits for an event that can only be caused by another process in the set.

- In our previous example, _P1_ is waiting for the __release event__ by the other process _P2_.

- There are four conditions for the occurrence of a deadlock:
    - 1. Mutual Exclusion
    - 2. Hold and Wait - a process is holding and waiting for a resource.
    - 3. No preemption
    - 4. Circular Wait - an extension to Hold and Wait. 

- If we can ensure that one of the condition from the list above fails, then we the system can be considered deadlock free.
