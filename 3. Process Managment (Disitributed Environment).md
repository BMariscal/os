## Chapter 3: Process Management (Distributed Environment)

- There are two types of models in the distributed environment, where the operating system operates and executes jobs differently: **Workstation Model** and **Processor Pool Model**. CPU allocation works different in the distributed environment. 


- In the workstation model, users are assigned a different workstation to operate in the network. Here every user has access to processing power. 


- In the processor pool model, users are provided a high-end terminal and connected to a high-end server (with many CPUs). In processor pool model, users are not provided access to processing power. The processing power is kept at a central location or the high-end server in this case.

 
- In the distributed environment there are two types of CPU allocation techniques: **Non-migratory** and **Migratory**. 


- Non-migratory is static in nature. In this environment, the processor in which a job is scheduled to execute is fixed and not editable. 


- In migratory environment, a process can be shifted for execution from one processor to another processor.
