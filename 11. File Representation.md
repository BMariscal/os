## Chapter 11: File Representation

- Index node (Inode) - stores the __disk layout__ of every file in the directory.

- The logical disk layout contains __boot block__, __super block__, __inode list__, __data block__.

- The location information of data blocks is stored in the Inode list.

- Super block contains:
  + how large the file system is
  + how many files it can store
  + where to find the free blocks in the file system
  + what are the free inodes

- For every read/write to a file, the Inode must be referenced because it contains the address and other key information of that file on disk. 

- To speed up the access of a data block from the file system, a copy of the inode list for that directory, called __incore inode__, is stored in main memory. When the inode is stored in the disk it is simply called __disk inode__.

- The disk inode contains the following information:
  + Ownership : who owns a specific file / directory
    * group / individual
  + Type (regular file or directory)
  + Permission field (read/write/execute - rwx)
  + access time
  + modification time
  + inode modified time
  + file size
  + disk address of different data blocks (TOC)

- The __Incore inode__ contains the following information:
  + Status 
      * 1. Locked
      * 2. A process is waiting for inode to become unlocked
      * 3. Changed
      * 4. File (corresponding to inode) changed or not
  + Device no. of File System
  + Inode Identification number (disk inode stored sequentially, therefore, doesn't need an identification number)
  + pointer fields (hash list and free list)
  + Reference Count - number of times inode is being referenced

- Whenever the reference count of an inode becomes 0, then the inode is pushed into the __inode free list__. 

- To access a specific byte in a file, a process must first get information about the address of that file in the inode. The inode is then locked (to avoid any changes) and the block address is obtained from the TOC. After the address has been obtained then the inode is unlocked again. When the inode become locked, no other process can access the file.

- __The inode table of contents (TOC)__:
  + The entries in a TOC contain 12 blocks of address. The first 10 addresses (0-9) contain the addresses of the block which contains file data. They are also called direct pointers.
  + The next address (10) is a __single indirect pointer__ pointing to a block (containing a set of pointers). The set of pointers then point to a block which contains the file data.
  + The next address (11) is a __double indirect pointer__ pointing to a block (containing a set of pointers) which also points to another block containing a set of pointers. The last block of pointers then point to a block that contains the file data.
  + Similarly, the next address (12) contains a __triple indirect pointer__ that follows the same structure as the previous.

```Pascal
// Assuming:
Block Size --> 1 KByte

// then...
Address of Block --> 4 Bytes
Every address block will contain 256 pointers

Direct pointers (10 addresses) can access --> 10 KBytes 
Single Indirect Pointers --> 256 KBytes
Double Indirect Pointers --> 256 X 256 KBytes
Triple Indirect Pointers --> 256 X 256 X 256 KBytes (16 GBytes)
```

- During any file operation:
  + 1. First, check if the inode of that file is in memory (the file could potentially be used by another process)
  + 2. Get a free inode to overwrite with the inode of the new file (obtained from secondary storage).

- Algorithm for getting Inode

```Pascal
While (not done)
  if (inode in inode cache)
    if (inode locked)
      sleep (event: inode is unlocked); // wait for inode to unlock
      continue;
    if (inode on free list) // reference count = 0
      remove inode from free list;
    increment Reference count field;
    return (inode);
  
  if (no inode in free list)
    return (error);
  remove (new inode from free list);
  reset inode number and file system;
  remove inode from hash old queue;
  add inode into new hash queue;
  read disk inode from the disk;
  put disk inode into new incore inode (block read algorithm);
  initialize the inode; // reference set to 1
  return (node);
```

- Algorithm for release inode:

```Pascal
lock inode if not already locked;
decrement reference count field;
if (reference == 0)
  if (inode changed)
    update disk inode;
  put inode on free inode list;
release inode lock;
```
