## Chapter 8: Cache Memory

- Cache memory is the most costly but the fastest of all memory types. Cache memory usually lies between CPU and memory. Use to store the data / instructions that are frequently used by the system. It is also used to store the page / segment map tables. 

- For cache memory, the physical address generated by the CPU has two components __(Block number, word in block)__. 


- The three types of cache memory are as follows: __Associative__, __Direct Mapped__, __Set Associative__.

- A __tag address__ is compared with the physical address generated for a particular instruction. If there is a match, then that instruction exist in cache memory. If not, the go to main memory fetch the data/instruction and put it in cache memory and save the tag. This tag memory / table work similar to the segment/page map table.

- __Parallel search__ is used to search if the block number exists or has a tag address.
