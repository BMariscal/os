## Chapter 2.1: Process Synchronization

- Main concept of process synchronization - mechanism to ensure the orderly execution of **cooperation processes** (processes that affect or be affected by other running processes) that share a logical address space (sharing code and data through threads), so that data consistency is maintained.


- **Critical section** - a segment code in which the process may be changing common variables, update a table, writing a file; when one process is executing in its critical section, no other process is allowed to execute in its critical section.

- critical section contains entry section, critical section, exit section, remainder section.

- The critical section problem is to design a protocol that the process can use to cooperate.

- Three requirements to solve critical section problem:
	+ Mutual exclusion - only one process can be executing in its critical section at the same time.
	+ Progress - after process is chosen to execute in its critical section, it must finish executing here so that other processes wanting to execute in their critical section can do so.
	+ Bounded waiting - process wanting to access their critical section are imposed with a bound or limit as to how many times they can access their critical section.
