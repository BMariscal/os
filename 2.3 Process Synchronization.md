## Chapter 2.1: Process Synchronization

- Main concept of process synchronization - mechanism to ensure the orderly execution of **cooperation processes** (processes that affect or be affected by other running processes) that share a logical address space (sharing code and data through threads), so that data consistency is maintained.


- **Critical section** - a segment code in which the process may be changing common variables, update a table, writing a file; when one process is executing in its critical section, no other process is allowed to execute in its critical section.

- critical section contains entry section, critical section, exit section, remainder section.

- The critical section problem is to design a protocol that the process can use to cooperate.

- Three requirements to solve critical section problem:
	+ Mutual exclusion - only one process can be executing in its critical section at the same time.
	+ Progress - after process is chosen to execute in its critical section, it must finish executing here so that other processes wanting to execute in their critical section can do so.
	+ Bounded waiting - process wanting to access their critical section are imposed with a bound or limit as to how many times they can access their critical section.

- test_and_set and compare_and_swap - Hardwares instruction to solve the critical section problem.

- Mutex locks - obtain mutual exclusion

- **Semaphores** behave a lot like mutex locks; semaphores provide more sophisticated ways to synchronize their activities; similar to mutex locks, classical semaphore suffers from busy waiting problem; instead of putting the process in busy waiting, the process is blocked and put into a WAITING state.

- In a single processor, semaphores use in interrupts to achieve atomicity; interrupts ensure that process do not interleave; In a multiprocessor environment, interrupts are disabled; SMP use locking techniques, such as spinlocks, to ensure that wait() and signal() are performed atomically.

- A set of processes is in a deadlocked state when every process in the set is waiting for an event that can be caused only by another process in the set.

- Priority inversion - there might be a case where a lower priority is holding a resource that another lower priority process get access of; and that a higher priority process wants to access; a solution is to only have two priorities and give higher priority to processes that are holding resources needed by other higher-priority processes.

- **Reader writer locks** generally require more overhead to establish than semaphores or mutex locks. 

- **Monitors** - is a high level ADT to avoid problems with programmers setting the wait() and signal() commands in the wrong order; setting these commands in the wrong order may cause deadlock or violation of mutual exclusion.
